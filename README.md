# React challenge repository

Here you'll find a simple static landing page developed to offer shared babysitting services and more.

## How to run the application in development mode

1. Install `yarn` in your local machine, check its [documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for a properly installation.

2. Clone this repository in your local machine, and enter the project directory.

3. Installing dependencies and running application in development mode:

	- Installing dependencies:
		```sh
		yarn
		```

	- Running application:
		```sh
		yarn start
		```

	The project should open in a new tab of your browser at any moment.

## How to build the application

By the time you installed the dependencies, the application was ready to be built, so all you have to do is run the following command:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Last considerations

I'd like to thank all people from Jungle Devs company for this amazing opportunity!

Even I can't get the job position as a Front End developer, for me was such a great challenge to be part of this selective process because there were so many things that I thought I wouldn't be able to get them done, but I put a lot of effort on myself like I never did before.

Besides that I'd like to apologize if the design is not good enough or if there's some other feature that was supposed to be here and it's not. I know that's not perfect at all and there is so much to be improved, done and implemented.

I'm really excited for what the future is bringing me and I'm ready to take more challenges!

I'm looking forward for feedbacks! Thank you and enjoy my application!

> Note: I know how to work with Sass but I decided not to do it here. Instead, I tried to implement some kind of pattern using the standard Cascade Styling Sheets.
