          <p>
            Sometimes it’s hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill.
            Try sharing that bill week in, week out and you might encounter more
            than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our
            automated payment system takes care of the rest. You need never talk
            money or who owes what.
