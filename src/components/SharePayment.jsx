        <h3>Shared payments made simple</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes itâ€™s hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill.
          Try sharing that bill week in, week out and you might encounter more
          than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our
          automated payment system takes care of the rest. You need never talk
          money or who owes what.
